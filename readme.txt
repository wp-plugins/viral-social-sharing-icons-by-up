== Description ==

= Viral Social Sharing =

With UP Social Sharing, as users start sharing your content on their favorite Social Networks, you can track their sharing behavior and get viral growth data, and (coming soon) users can get points they can cash in for cool stuff in the UP Store. Users sign up for UP once by expanding the UP icon, then each time they’re Sharing your content across Social Networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or LinkedIn, they get points – and you get powerful cross-network Social data on how your users are Sharing your content on their social networks.

You can also turn OFF the UP icon if you simply want simple, cloud-based, responsive sharing buttons that work on the web and mobile WITHOUT sharing incentives.

However, if you keep the up icon ON, users don’t even need to share using your Social Sharing widget for you to get incredibly detailed viral data – they can just copy and paste the link or share in any other way, and we’ll be able to track what they share automatically.

UP’s customizable platform and Viral Social Sharing plugin help you optimize your content, blog posts and pages for more social sharing engagement, and a wider viral reach.

What’s more - by signing up as an UP Partner for free after installing UP Viral Social Sharing icons, you can control the placement of your Social Buttons on your UP Partner Dashboard, you get access to Sharing demographic data and Sharing behavior to help you get to know your most viral users, and turn your visitors into evangelists.

You don’t just want people Sharing your content – you want them to start CONVERSATIONS around your content that their networks engage in and start Sharing. You also want your site to be PROMOTED to other users who are sharing similar sites on their social networks and social media accounts. This Viral Social Sharing widget is a great first step, but unlike other widgets, UP doesn’t stop there.

Stop begging users to start Sharing your content and giving them nothing in return. Use Viral Social Sharing by UP, track viral growth, run tests, measure improvement, and give people a reason to share!

100% responsive, works on all browsers and devices, cloud-based, lightening-fast, will never slow your site down. It’s our job to help you grow your viral reach through incentivized social media sharing!
